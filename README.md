Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

- Description: This project is a tic-tac-toe web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  
- Objective: The goal of this project is to provide users with an interactive and engaging experience while playing the classic tic-tac-toe game.

- Features:
  - Users can click on the game board to make their moves.
  - The application tracks the state of the game, including the positions of X and O markers on the board.
  - Checks for winning conditions after each move to determine if a player has won.
  - Supports player vs. player mode for users to play against each other.
  - Designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.

- How to Play:
  1. Open the tic-tac-toe web application in a web browser.
  2. Players take turns clicking on the cells of the game board to place their markers (X or O).
  3. The game will track the moves and check for winning conditions after each move.
  4. Declare a winner if a player gets three markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or declare a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.
